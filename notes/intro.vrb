\begin{lstlisting}[style=colorful, language=Python]
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    \end{lstlisting}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In this example, the \texttt{while} loop prints the value of \texttt{i} as long as \texttt{i} is less than 5.
        \item The value of \texttt{i} is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
    \end{itemize}
